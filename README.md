# Lennon Wall ICU

[Lennon Wall ICU](https://lennonwall.icu) is a web app as a permanent place for freedom of expression.

The app uses [web3js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) utility to create transactions and allow users to execute them with MetaMask.

The message reader uses Etherscan API to receive transaction data. The app then converts the hexadecimal message back into UTF-8 and presents it to the user.

There is no back-end code and no database, all logic is on the front-end, written in Vue.js.
